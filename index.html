		<h4>About the band</h4>
		<p>Sex Bob-omb is Scott's indie rock band, comprising of Stephen Stills (vocals and guitar), Scott Pilgrim (bass), Kim Pine (drums) and Young Neil (biggest fan and understudy bass). The name is a double reference to Bob-omb, an enemy from the Super Mario series and either the Flipper song "Sex Bomb" or the Tom Jones song "Sex Bomb." Also a reference to real life band Sex Pistols.</p>

		<p>They are an average band, neither wildly popular nor terrible, though the tedium of later recording their album results in the band hardly ever playing gigs or practicing and getting rusty. </p>
